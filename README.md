From 69 applications submitted by 39 organizations, institutions, universities, research institutes, businesses across the country, as well as the Vietnamese Embassy, the Vietnamese Youth and Student Associations abroad, the Central Secretariat of the Youth Union has decided to award the 2024 Golden Globe Science and Technology Award to 10 outstanding young scientists based on the nominations of the Golden Globe Science and Technology Award Council. The awards are distributed across the following fields:

1. Information Technology, Digital Transformation, and Automation: 03 individuals.
2. Medical and Pharmaceutical Technology: 01 individual.
3. Biotechnology: 01 individual.
4. Environmental Technology: 02 individuals.
5. New Material Technology: 03 individuals.

Among the recipients is Dr. Kim-Hung Le, a lecturer at the University of Information Technology, who is recognized as one of the 10 outstanding figures receiving this year‚Äôs Golden Globe Award.

All 10 young scientists honored with the Golden Globe Science and Technology Award have demonstrated outstanding research achievements, obtained multiple patents and useful solutions, published high-quality international papers, and received numerous domestic and international awards and medals.

The 2024 Golden Globe Science and Technology Award Ceremony is scheduled to take place on November 7-8, 2024, in Hanoi.

abstract: The increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted our daily lives in the past few years. On one hand, it brings convenience, simplicity, and efficiency for us; on the other hand, the devices are susceptible to various cyber-attacks due to the lack of solid security mechanisms and hardware security support. In this paper, we present IMIDS, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) to protect IoT devices. IMIDS‚Äôs core is a lightweight convolutional neural network model to classify multiple cyber threats. To mitigate the training data shortage issue, we also propose an attack data generator powered by a conditional generative adversarial network. In the experiment, we demonstrate that IMIDS could detect nine cyber-attack types (e.g., backdoors, shellcode, worms) with an average F-measure of 97.22% and outperforms its competitors. Furthermore, IMIDS‚Äôs detection performance is notably improved after being further trained by the data generated by our attack data generator. These results demonstrate that IMIDS can be a practical IDS for the IoT scenario.
