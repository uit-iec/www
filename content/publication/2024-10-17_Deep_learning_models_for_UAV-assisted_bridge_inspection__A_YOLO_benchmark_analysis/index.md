abstract: Visual inspections of bridges are critical to ensure their safety and identify potential failures early. This inspection process can be rapidly and accurately automated by using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) integrated with deep learning models. However, choosing an appropriate model that is lightweight enough to integrate into the UAV and fulfills the strict requirements for inference time and accuracy is challenging. Therefore, our work contributes to the advancement of this model selection process by conducting a benchmark of 23 models belonging to the four newest YOLO variants (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8) on COCO-Bridge-2021+, a dataset for bridge details detection. Through comprehensive bench-marking, we identify YOLOv8n, YOLOv7tiny, YOLOv6m, and YOLOv6m6 as the models offering an optimal balance between accuracy and processing speed, with mAP@50 scores of 0.803, 0.837, 0 …
