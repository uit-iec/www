abstract: Border security has always been one of the top priority obligations and responsibilities in protecting the peace of nations. Most nations have thousands of kilometers of long borders, where illegal activities occur frequently. To ensure safety, robust and timely border surveillance systems are in high demand. However, current border surveillance systems using cloud architecture have faced several problems with high latency, bandwidth consumption, and security risks. In this paper, we introduce a real-time border surveillance system based on edge computing that shifts computation tasks from cloud to edge, resulting in alleviating existing problems. In detail, we produce a lightweight human detection model based on the MobileNet architecture, namely BorderEdge, to operate on resource-constrained devices effectively. Our experiment results on Raspberry Pi 4 show that our system could achieve high accuracy with …
