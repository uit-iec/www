abstract: Energy conservation techniques are crucial to achieving high reliability in the Internet of Things (IoT) services, especially in the Massive IoT (MIoT), which stringently requires cost-effective and low-energy consumption for battery-powered devices. Most of the proposed techniques generally assume that data acquiring and processing consume significantly lower than that of communication. Unfortunately, this assumption is incorrect in the MIoT scenario, which mostly involves the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) and complex data sensing operations (e.g., biological and seismic sensing) using “power-hungry” sensors (e.g., gas sensors, seismometers). Thus, sensing actions may consume even more energy than transmission. In addition, none of them support end-users in controlling the trade-off between energy conservation and data precision. To deal with these issues, we propose an adaptive sampling …
