abstract: Air pollution is a serious global issue that affects the health of millions of people worldwide. Machine learning models have shown promise in accurate prediction of the air quality index (AQI), which plays a crucial role in controlling and mitigating their impact. However, existing approaches have limitations in capturing temporal dependencies and analyzing frequency domain relationships among pollutants. In this study, we propose a novel multi-input model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture, incorporating wavelet transformation for enhanced air quality prediction. The model first decomposes air quality data from neighboring regions into frequency components using wavelet transform, then extract valuable characteristic information and relationships using the Bi-LSTM module. This make our model effectively captures features across both temporal and frequency domains …
