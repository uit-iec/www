abstract: With the proliferation of web applications, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks have increased significantly and now pose a significant threat to users' information security and privacy. To enhance the efficiency of XSS attack detection, the adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques offers promising solutions, but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of comprehensive and diverse datasets. Moreover, existing approaches often prioritize detection accuracy over real-time processing capabilities, which are essential for effective defense. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that automatically collects web resources, efficiently extracts informative features, and constructs an up-to-date XSS attack dataset, which is then used to train a machine learning-based XSS detection model. Using this framework, we created and published a well-structured dataset over …
