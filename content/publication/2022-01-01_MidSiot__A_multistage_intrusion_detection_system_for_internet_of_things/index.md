abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) has been thriving in recent years, playing an important role in a multitude of various domains, including industry 4.0, smart transportation, home automation, and healthcare. As a result, a massive number of IoT devices are deployed to collect data from our surrounding environment and transfer these data to other systems over the Internet. This may lead to cybersecurity threats, such as denial of service attacks, brute‐force attacks, and unauthorized accesses. Unfortunately, many IoT devices lack solid security mechanisms and hardware security supports because of their limitations in computational capability. In addition, the heterogeneity of devices in IoT networks causes nontrivial challenges in detecting security threats. In this article, we present a collaborative intrusion detection system (IDS), namely, MidSiot, deployed at both Internet gateways and IoT local gateways. Our proposed IDS …
