abstract: Recently, the Massive Internet of Things (IoT) and Web of Things (WoT) are remarkable research fields aiming to facilitate the connectivity, accessibility, and control of the Things by Web standards and technologies for large-scale deployment. In such context, the end-user is capable of simply creating, mashing-up, and presenting the multiple Things to gain high-level information. However, current research approaches much more pay attention to describe a single Thing. The modeling and building the application for the compound objects consisting of groups of Things namely "Asset" are still limited due to the lack of description and seamless integration mechanism. Moreover, the traditional IoT Device Description Language directly installed on device is highly restricted in Massive IoT scenario because of stringent requirements for power consumption and operation cost. In this paper, we introduce the WoT based …
