abstract: Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) promises a lot of positive impacts on manufacturing, process transformation and digital value acceleration. IIoT is considered to have the potential to launch fourth industrial revolution and related economies. However, since IIoT is at its early stage, its benefits are limited to connected devices and open data sources to enrich the measurements and analysis. In this paper, we propose an innovative IIoT framework that could automate the process of creating cloud-based middleware connector for things used in industrial settings. The framework significantly accelerates the configuration process for heterogeneous connections by using a light-weight and convenient connector template and supports the common set of protocols. Interoperability with other such implementations is preserved using ongoing IoT standardization.
