abstract: Monitoring Air Quality Index (AQI) provides comprehensive air quality and valuable information about health risks and environmental impacts. The proliferation of IoT devices has enabled real-time AQI prediction by allowing individuals to locally collect and analyze air quality. However, deploying these AQI prediction models on resource-constrained IoT devices poses significant challenges, including computational limitations, model optimization, and data synchronization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model combining convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks to predict the hourly air quality index. Our proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 95% while maintaining a lightweight model size. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can operate effectively on resource-constrained devices, such as the Raspberry Pi 3, without impacting other tasks.
