abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) serves demands in our life ranging from smart homes and smart cities to manufacturing and many other industries. As a result of the massive deployment of IoT devices, the risk of cyber-attacks on these devices also increases. The limitation in computing resources of IoT devices stops people from directly operating antivirus software on them. Therefore, these devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this research, we present our novel approach that could be applied to construct a lightweight Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) on IoT gateways. We utilize TabNet-the Google’s recently developed model for tabular data-as our detection model. The evaluation results on BOT-IoT and UNSW-NB15 datasets prove the ability of our proposal in intrusion detection tasks with the accuracy of 98,53% and 99,43%. Finally, we experiment with our approach on the …
