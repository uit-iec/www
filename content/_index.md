        <br>
        The Intelligent Edge Research Group, led by Dr. Kim-Hung Le at the University of Information Technology (UIT), VNU-HCM, blends theory and system research to pioneer advancements in Edge AI and AI Security. Our work in Edge AI focuses on empowering on-device intelligence for resource-constrained systems like UAVs and robotics, innovating techniques such as model optimization and federated learning to maximize edge performance, and developing resource-efficient LLMs/SLMs and autonomous agents for edge deployment. In AI Security, we are building next-generation AI-powered cyber defenses (IDS/IPS), enhancing the trustworthiness and adversarial resilience of AI models, and pioneering security frameworks for the quantum era.
