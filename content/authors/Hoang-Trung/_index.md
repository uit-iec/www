Driven by a strong interest in technology, I am building a career in IT, with experience spanning Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. I have achieved notable results in AI competitions and research projects, particularly in Deep Learning Security and Natural Language Processing.

I hold a BSc in Artificial Intelligence from HCMUS with an outstanding GPA of 9.07/10 and am currently advancing my expertise by pursuing an MSc in the same field. Alongside my studies, I have actively contributed to the AI research community by co-authoring multiple papers submitted to international journals and conferences through the IEC Research Lab.

My research focuses on key areas within Deep Learning Security (including Model Inversion, Layer Attack and Defense, and Machine Unlearning) and Multimodal Learning (with an emphasis on enhancing modal fusion).
