As a dedicated researcher, I bring a wealth of experience and
a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and
information security. My main objectives are strengthening the
security landscape with the applications of AI, and exploring different
sophisticated attacks and defenses for AI models.

Some of my achievements are:
- Valedictorian of the Honor Program in Information Security with an
outstanding GPA of 9.08/10.
- First author of the ISI-Q2 paper, titled "MidSiot: A Multi-stage
Intrusion Detection System for Internet of Things".

Additionally, I firmly believe that intelligence is the inevitable outcome
of hard- and smart-working. Also, I believe that there are no such
difficult things, there are just things we've not spent enough time
on. These make me a lifelong learner with a strong passion for
discovering impactful knowledge that makes the world we are living
better and safer.
