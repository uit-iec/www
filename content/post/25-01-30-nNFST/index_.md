We are delighted to announce a significant research publication in the prestigious international Journal of Network and Computer Applications. This work represents a notable advancement in the field of cybersecurity. The paper, titled "nNFST: A single-model approach for multiclass novelty detection in network intrusion detection systems," was published in April 2025.

The research introduces "nNFST," a novel single-model approach designed for multiclass novelty detection within network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). This study addresses the critical challenge of identifying new and unseen threats in network traffic, which is essential for maintaining robust cybersecurity postures. The key contribution of this paper is the development of an innovative methodology that allows for the detection of various types of novel network attacks using a unified model, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the capabilities of network security systems against emerging and evolving cyber threats. By providing a more effective way to detect zero-day attacks and other unknown malicious activities, the nNFST approach can contribute to stronger network defenses for organizations and individuals alike. This work is a testament to the ongoing efforts to create more intelligent and adaptive security solutions in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

Our institution proudly recognizes the cutting-edge research and dedication demonstrated in this publication. We congratulate the authors, Xuan-Ha Nguyen and Kim-Hung Le, on this important academic achievement. Their contribution to the Journal of Network and Computer Applications is a valuable addition to the scientific community, and we anticipate its positive impact on the future of network intrusion detection.
